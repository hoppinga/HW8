                        Af Klint was born in Stockholm in 1862 to a middle class family. She was the first woman 
                        to attend the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Stockholm, where she studied drawing and painting, 
                        and began creating landscapes, portraits, and scientific illustrations. She also joined the 
                        Theosophical Society and developed a deepening interest in spiritualism and spiritual movements, 
                        believing humans could communicate with other realms.

                    <p id="p-2">
                        Unlike most artists of her time, af Klint rarely exhibited her work and stipulated that her paintings 
                        not be shown until 20 years after her death because she didnâ€™t feel the public would understand them. 
                        Because of this, her work was all but unseen until the 1980s. Once it was discovered, artists and historians 
                        were dumbfounded by the abstract, futuristic, and imaginative qualities of her work that predated associated 
                        art movements. She became known as an artist well ahead of her time.
